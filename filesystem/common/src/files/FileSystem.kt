 * An interface providing basic operations on a filesystem, such as reading and writing files,
 * creating directories, gathering file metadata and so on.
 *
 * Default implementation of this interface is [SystemFileSystem]. It provides access to files and directories
 * on disk.
 *
 * The interface is sealed until API stabilization, but in the future it will allow
 * creating custom filesystems that could be used as mocks for testing or provide
 * access to some network resources and allow working with them as with regular files, for example.
 *
 * **This API is unstable and subject to change.**
 *
 * ### Thread-safety guarantees
 *
 * Until stated otherwise, [FileSystem] implementation are not thread safe.
 * If a [FileSystem] needs to be accessed from multiple threads, an additional synchronization is required.
