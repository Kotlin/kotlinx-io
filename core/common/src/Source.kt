/**
 * A source that facilitates typed data reads and keeps a buffer internally so that callers can read chunks of data
 * without requesting it from a downstream on every call.
 *
 * [Source] is the main `kotlinx-io` interface to read data in client's code,
 * any [RawSource] could be converted into [Source] using [RawSource.buffered].
 *
 * Depending on the kind of downstream and the number of bytes read, buffering may improve the performance by hiding
 * the latency of small reads.
 *
 * The buffer is refilled on reads as necessary, but it is also possible to ensure it contains enough data
 * using [require] or [request].
 * [Sink] also allows skipping unneeded prefix of data using [skip] and
 * provides look ahead into incoming data, buffering as much as necessary, using [peek].
 *
 * Source's read* methods have different guarantees of how much data will be consumed from the source
 * and what to expect in case of error.
 *
 * ### Read methods' behavior and naming conventions
 *
 * Unless stated otherwise, all read methods consume the exact number of bytes
 * requested (or the number of bytes required to represent a value of a requested type).
 * If a source contains fewer bytes than requested, these methods will throw an exception.
 *
 * Methods reading up to requested number of bytes are named as `readAtMost`
 * in contrast to methods reading exact number of bytes, which don't have `AtMost` suffix in their names.
 * If a source contains fewer bytes than requested, these methods will not treat it as en error and will return
 * gracefully.
 *
 * Methods returning a value as a result are named `read<Type>`, like [readInt] or [readByte].
 * These methods don't consume source's content in case of an error.
 *
 * Methods reading data into a consumer supplied as one of its arguments are named `read*To`,
 * like [readTo] or [readAtMostTo]. These methods consume a source even when an error occurs.
 *
 * Methods moving all data from a source to some other sink are named `transferTo`, like [transferTo].
 *
 * It is recommended to follow the same naming convention for Source extensions.
 *
 * ### Thread-safety guarantees
 *
 * Until stated otherwise, [Source] implementations are not thread safe.
 * If a [Source] needs to be accessed from multiple threads, an additional synchronization is required.
