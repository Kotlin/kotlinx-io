# CHANGELOG

## 0.6.0
> Published 19 November 2024

### Features
- On JVM, libraries now include Java Platform Module System (JPMS) modules [#406](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/pull/406)
- Made Segment's size and capacity public [#409](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/pull/409)
- Improved performance of extension functions reading and writing using little-endian byte order [#414](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/pull/414)
- Minor documentation improvements

## 0.5.4
> Published 17 September 2024

### Features
- Extended Unsafe API with a function allowing to iterate over all Buffer's segments [#383](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/pull/383)
- Implemented `ByteString` conversion to/from `NSData` on Apple platforms [#384](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/pull/384)
- Implemented extensions to read/write `ByteString` from to/from `ByteBuffer`, as well as representing
  `ByteString` as a read-only `ByteBuffer` on JVM [#387](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/pull/387)
- Implemented `ByteString` factory accepting unsigned bytes [#390](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/pull/390)
- Reimplemented various functions using Unsafe API [#337](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/pull/337)

## 0.5.3
> Published 19 August 2024

### Features
- Updated JS `braces` library to `3.0.3` 
- More unnecessary backing fields were eliminated [#374](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/pull/374)

## 0.5.2
> Published 15 August 2024
 
### Features
- Unsafe API method signatures were updated to return number of written/read bytes [#360](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/issues/360)

  Note that it's a breaking change as return type is a part of method signature.
  However, updated methods are all inline, so in general, 
  projects depending on libraries that were compiled against the previous version
  should not experience binary incompatibility issues after adding a dependency on a never `kotlinx-io` version.
  
- Added call-in-place contracts to Unsafe API methods [#361](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/issues/361) 
- Updated Gradle and some dependencies [#353](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/pull/353)
- Improved build scripts [#371](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/pull/371)
- Removed the `Buffer.buffer` backing field [#366](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/pull/366)

## 0.5.1
> Published 15 July 2024

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug in segment pool implementation affecting a second level pool uses.

## 0.5.0
> Published 12 July 2024

### Features
- Provided an API allowing direct access to Buffer and Segment internals [#135](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/issues/135), [#166](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/issues/166)

  The API is unsafe, delisted from public docs and requires explicit opt-in. It's recommended to
  avoid this API unless you're working on integration with other APIs (like, `java.nio` or
  `io_uring`, for example).

- Improved the way segment pooling is working on JVM [#352](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-io/pull/352)

  Now sharing a segment won't make an original segment and all its copies recyclable.
  Instead, the last remaining copy will be placed back into the pool when recycled.
  Segments are no longer allocated or lost when taking or recycling a segment from pool
  under a high contention due to concurrent requests.
  Size of the segment pool on the JVM could now be statically configured by setting a system property
  `kotlinx.io.pool.size.bytes`.
