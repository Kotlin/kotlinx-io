What needs to be done:
- [+] add tests for predicates
- [+] finalize predicates naming
- [+] add example of async sink and sources
- [+] add tests for cancellation
- [+] figure out what to do with the runBlocking in common sourceset
- [+] add example of code sharing between sync and async IO primitives
- [ ] add interop functions (like transferTo/From)
- [ ] finish Module.md
- [+] add docs for classes
- [+] what should we throw out of await?
- [ ] add samples
- [ ] what should happen when the flush called from the close is cancelled?
- [+] do we need a separate `cancel` method?
- [+] maybe the fetchMore should accept max number of bytes to fetch?
- [+] is closing an underlying source if an expection or just unfulfilled predicate in terms of `tryAwait`?
- [+] do we need a public emit in AsyncSink?
